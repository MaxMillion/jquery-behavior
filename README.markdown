## jQuery Behavior Plugin:
Define rich behaviors that include both event handlers, helpers and (un)transformations on DOM elements.

## Behavior is following the idea of NinjaScript:
"[...] a jQuery library designed to allow unobstrusive scripting simply and easily. Essentially, we use jQuery selectors to apply behavior the same way we use CSS stylesheets to apply stylings."

Behavior isn't based on NinjaScript, instead it depends on Live Query by Brandon Aaron and Methods plugin for jQuery (for optional helpers) by Ronald Schouten.
